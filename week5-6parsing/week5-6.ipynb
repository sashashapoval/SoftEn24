    "Key notions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Web scraping** is data collection from websites. In other words, it is a technique used for extracting large amounts of data from web pages, in which the data is retrieved and then stored in a file on your computer or in a database in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parsing** (in computer science). In practice, parsing is almost always turning a string, or binary data, into a data structure inside your program. The term is also used to describe a split or separation. Formally speaking, it is a syntactic analysis of the input symbols into its component parts in order to facilitate the writing of compilers and interpreters."

    "## What is HTML? \n",
    "\n",
    "**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**  — is the standard markup language (like LaTeX or Markdown) for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser (Google Chrome, Safari or any other). So, it's a standard language for writing various sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "HTML **tags** are the foundation of the HTML language. Tags are used to delimit the beginning and end of elements in markup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTML page is a collection of nested tags. Example of tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `<title>` - page title\n",
    "- `<h1> ... <h6>` - headings of different levels\n",
    "- `<p>` - paragraph\n",
    "- `<div>` - a division or a section in a document, it is used as a container for HTML elements\n",
    "- `<table>` - drawing the table\n",
    "- `<tr>` - separator for rows in the table\n",
    "- `<td>` - separator for columns in the table\n",
    "- `<b>` - sets the font to bold\n",
    "- `<i>` - italic text\n",
    "\n",
    "Command `<...>` opens a tag and `</...>` closes it. The tag properties apply to everything in between the two commands. For instance, everuthing in between `<p>` and `</p>` — is a separate paragraph.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Tags form a tree rooted in the `<html>` tag and break the page into different logical pieces. Each tag has its own parents and their descendants (children) - those tags that are nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of HTML-tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "````html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head> Some regular title </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            The first piece of text. \n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            Some text here.\n",
    "                <b>\n",
    "                    This text will be bold. \n",
    "                </b>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "        One more piece of text...\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "You can work with this html as with text, or as a tree. Traversing this tree is web page parsing. We will just find the nodes we need among all this variety and take information from them!\n",

      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         However, shipping is likely to also be needed to transport oil to parts of the country not serviced by pipelines.  Based upon the support offered by American carriers and labor unions, we expect the Jones Act-qualified vessels will be available to meet those needs.\n",

      "         Q    Thank you so much, and thanks for taking my question.  To better understand how this latest release is going to bring down gas prices, can you share what the deficit is in the global market supply of oil since the U.S. and other nations sanctioned Russian oil?  In other words, every day, how many millions of oil — barrels of oil have been removed from the market supply?\n",

      "        <p>\n",
      "         First, when it comes to the effect on global supply, what we know is that there is reduced global supply right now.  Obviously, outside analysts have given us sort of a range of estimates of the reduction in supply.  We know, for instance, that, you know, across points of last year, the United States was importing 700,000 barrels per day of crude and petroleum product from Russia; we obviously have now banned those imports.\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         What we know is that there is a lack of supply and that the kind of action that the President is taking today, this historic action — the million barrels per day that will be released from the reserve over the next six months as we see a ramp-up in U.S. production and production elsewhere — will be very important in helping to address that lack of supply.\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         When it comes to, you know, how quickly will this translate into relief: You know, obviously, we’ve seen, even overnight, markets responding to the initial news of a reserve release — where we’ve seen, you know, with a reduction in the oil price.\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         But we’re not focused right now on sort of the immediate, short-term price movements.  What we’re focused on is a real challenge we have.  You know, looking ahead with Russian supply coming off the market, we want to address that lack of supply.  We know and believe that that will then translate into helping to provide relief to American consumers.  We think that this historic release from the reserve will be an important step in that direction, will have meaningful effects.  And then, in combination with actions by other countries taken around the world, it will mean we will have well in excess of a million barrels per day being released from reserves around the world in response.\n",

      "         Q    Hey, thanks very much for doing this.  Just to follow up on Weijia’s question, you just said that you think this release will be an important step in the direction of helping to reduce gas prices.  But do you not have an estimate of how quickly that will happen or by how much Americans can expect to see their gas prices reduced, say in three months from now or six months from now?\n",

      "        <p>\n",
      "         SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  So, what we — where we’re focused is a structural challenge right now in the oil market as a result of Putin’s actions.  We know that there is too little supply to meet demand, as Russian oil was coming off the market.  Obviously, United States banned Russian imports; others also are not purchasing.  We know that there’s a reduction in supply.  And we are focused on the difference, that deficit between supply and demand, and that this historic action — a million barrels per day — will help to address that in coordination with other countries around the world.\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         You know, when it comes to the particular price effects, there is good evidence from studies of prior reserve releases that it can have significant effects in that sort of interim period, that short-term period, in order to provide relief.  That’s where we’re focused.  This is a bridge towards greater supply coming on the market from production both in the United States and elsewhere.\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         When it comes to the refilling, restocking the reserves, all of the funds that will be attained by the Department of Energy as a result of the sale of this oil will then go to restocking the reserve.  That is an authority that the Department of Energy already has; that’s how they can deploy those funds.  We expect that to occur.  Once the oil price has come down, we are no longer in an emergency.  You know, I direct you to the Department of Energy for more details on that.\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         The final thing I would say: You know, our commitment to restocking the reserve in order for it to be ready for future emergencies also can have good effects right now.  It can encourage the additional production we need right now in order to respond to Putin’s action.  So there really is a double benefit, both making sure that we are ready for future emergencies and also encouraging the production we need immediately in order to respond to Putin’s actions.\n",

The function should return to the output the objects that were downloaded. It fails at the $50$th object. Of course, the function does not return what has already been downloaded. Everything that you've been downloading - you lose. It should be executed again. Why? Because the function has its own namespace. If you did it in a loop, then you could save the first $50$ of objects that are already inside the list, and then continue the download.\n",
